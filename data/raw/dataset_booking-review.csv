I went for a deep cleansing facial and the lady put tinted moisturizer on my face and pretended that she did such an amazing job. I don’t wear makeup so this was quite annoying when the purpose of my visit was for a deep clean. The massage was not great either. The ladies were kind but I regret going.
The entertainment had good energy for kids but was too loud and harmful to the hearing of the kids they called to come to the stage. I requested them to lower the volume but was disregarded multiple times over our two week stay. Also one of the French guys who did entertainment was very rude when we asked to turn down the volume.","Beautiful hotel, excellent buffet selection (especially the seafood night), great views!! I would recommend this resort to anyone who doesn’t want to leave their location they have everything you need and multiple areas to enjoy the view. Great for couples and families. The cocktails by the beach were excellent. The front desk was very kind and accommodating.

Très déçu, nous leurs avons fait part de notre mécontentement. L'hôtel a de suite prit les devants afin de nous proposer le meilleur service pour que nous puissions tout de même profiter de l'hôtel.
TRÈS BELLE SURPRISE.
Nous avons été placé en Suite Junior all inclusive inclusive avec vue sur mer, la chambre était très propre, et fonctionnelle. La vue... Exceptionnelle.
Nous avons vite oublié la piscine privée, qui ne nous aurait pas servie à grand chose vu le nombre de piscines qu'il y a dans l'hôtel, en plus de la mer.
Le personnel de l'hôtel est serviable, agréable, prend la peine de parler  français lorsque vous avez du mal avec les langues étrangères.
De nombreuse activités sont proposées, tel que, basket, pétanque, quad etc..
La randonnée en Quad est à faire, c'était vraiment top.
Le buffet est varié, et bon à chaque repas. Tout est frais, il y en a pour tout les goûts.

"gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia","f4738986b031e1e0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"8.0","July 23, 2023",,"7",,"To improve
There’s not a lot I can complain about, more small improvements I would expect the resort to do to get to be a real 5-stars.
Our room didn’t have a single chair where to put things inside. And it’s very easy to spend 50€ on a cheap chair so at least one would have it.
And it didn’t have anything to hang wet swimsuits outside.
We had to use the 4 outdoor chairs to put our wet things. Easy improvement is to spend 5€ on a plastic drying rack and fix it to a wall and remove the annoyance.
There was no easily available shower in the pool areas, despite there being a sign saying that one had to shower before entering the pool. Pretty weird. 100€ would give you enough money to install one.
There was no lifeguard on duty anywhere, this is a pretty serious issue to me as a father of two kids (despite them being expert swimmers). I would invest in hiring someone. That could also help ending the bad practice of “reserving” Sun beds early in the morning from customers.
Room doors are surprisingly thin and walls don’t insulate very well from noises, bring earplugs if you want to sleep.
One night a bunch of not-so-smart folks started kicking doors and managed to even open one, with just one strong kick. That needs a review from the hotel.
Air conditioning filters would need to be cleaned regularly, as after heavy use ours started pumping bad quality air in. I don’t know how often it happens. Once a month is enough, but filters need to be cleaned more often than they are now. Simple but a must.
Overall food quality is good, and i understand that it’s difficult to keep quality of every single dish high. One thing I would invest in however is to improve the quality of the products available: especially jam, oil, coke, orange juices, coffee and such . Those are small cost items, but having a bad quality jam or low quality oil (especially for a country that produces one of the best olive oils on the planet) can be easily spotted (and easily improved).","The location of the resort is absolutely stunning, get a room with sea view and you’ll wake up every day with an amazing feeling. The resort is situated on a cliff overlooking the blue sea of Crete, and since it’s a small gulf it is well protected from waves and wind in most directions. It gets windy only when the wind comes from northeast, otherwise the sea is flat like a table.
The room seemed pretty new (in 2023), clean and spacious. Beds very comfortable. Curtains cover pretty well the sun in the morning but depending in how sensitive you are to light you might want to bring some night mask. There’s air conditioning in case it gets hot (and it will).
In our room there was a big wardrobe with plenty of space for our needs.
A water boiler and a fridge were also available.
A safe box was also there to keep our valuables.
The restaurant is very functional and given the big amount of guests it favors quantity over quality. Not that quality is bad, but it varies a lot depending on the food, it’s an inconsistent experience.
We loved the freshly baked pizzas, the meat, pork and fish cooked on the grill and the fresh veggies and fruits. Breakfast (which opens at 3AM!!!) was rich, we loved the crepes and the fresh pastries.
The two pools (one with sea water) are large enough for all the guests. There’s also a spa with an additional pool (which we didn’t use).
The private “beach” (which in reality is a concrete deck) is fantastic, almost never crowded, and gives you access to crystal clear water and a beautiful seabed, you have to walk more than a few steps down to reach it (and up again) but totally worth it.
You can also access two public beaches (Psaramoura and Mononafitis) in case you want variety, where you can rent sun beds and umbrellas in case you want, but where you can also find a corner to put your stuff  and dive in the sea.
There’s a scuba diving school in case you are interested and you can rent boats and pedal boats in case.","Superb location, very good food, fantastic sea, great vacation. Missing just a few details to reach excellent status.","Two-Bedroom Bungalow with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","July 2023","10 nights","Family","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-s/d321d61d78a8fa310843e1967dca38e6276b92aa.png","Finland","Stefano"

Da unsere schon groß sind, war das für uns allerdings kein Problem.- Der Ort ist ungefähr 20 Gehminuten entfernt und eher weniger interessant. Für Leute die Nightlife oder Shopping wollen, ist das nix.  - Die vielen Stufen sind sicher auch nicht jedermanns/frau Sache. - Der Strand ist ein Kiesstrand der öffentlich ist (also nicht nur Hotelgäste). Das Hotel hat aber eine Betonplattform von der man direkt ins Meer kann -- für uns war das perfekt.- Die Fleischgerichte haben uns weniger geschmeckt.","Da das Hotel auf einem Felsen über dem Meer ragt, hat man eine wunderschöne Aussicht auf das Meer. Der Standort bringt aber für Leute mit Gehbehinderungen Schwierigkeiten, da man einige Höhenmeter überbrücken muss um zwischen Meerebene, Poolebene, Zimmerebene und Essen hin und her zu gehen. Wir habe es als Fitnesstraining betrachtet :)Zimmer waren sehr sauber und modern eingerichtet - alles ohne schnick-schnack. Wunderschöne Aussicht aufs Meer!Das Essen war einfach und gut -- vor allem die vegetarischen Gerichte.Das Personal war nett aber zurückhaltend. Es gibt eine Animation -- allerdings nur auf Französisch. Zum Mitturnen haben meine Französischkenntnisse gereicht :)","Wonderful","Two-Bedroom Family Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2021","9 nights","Family","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-m/0e43c9b9a23d334b52510a328641c048847226bc.png","Austria","Mi"

Bibite non originali; soprattutto il caffè che era per la maggior parte acqua. Ristornate non pulito al massimo.

Struttura molto moderna e curata. Belle camere; molto spaziose e confortevoli. Avevamo una vista mare eccezionale (nella seconda stanza, la prima aveva una siepe coprente).

Carino il negozio di souvenir all'interno della struttura (tutte le varie sale collegate con ascensore o passaggi). Un grazie ed un complimento speciale alla signora Fotinì, e alla ragazza della reception che parlava molto bene l'italiano: cordiali e sempre disponibili per qualsiasi richiesta.

The kitchen and dining hall was well organised although the number of guests rose suddenly up by 100 guests in one day when more and more holidaymakers arrived. The staff were always ready to keep up the good spirit and cleanliness. It was a beautiful privilege to see how even the head chef and his number two showed up in the dining room and we could express our gratitude him about food. Just before we left, main chef suprice us with an unforgettable surprise.   It was always a pleasant to return to our room after it was cleaned everyday by a warm-hearted Maria. And similarly we saw how everyone did their job with a good heart while serving us. The hotel's surroundings are peaceful and pleasant to take walks to, for example, a small nearby village.

Especially when you're hanging out at the Tsimento bar (the hotel's private beach bar), it's all paid cocktails.- The lunch and dinner grill only served one type of meat, mostly pork. Should have at least an option for non-pork eaters- Seafood night was on a weekday (Tuesday) when we stayed. We're not sure if it's rotated, hence only selected guests who stay long enough will get to enjoy it. Should have made it on a weekend night.- Choices were aplenty at the buffet but were not properly labelled, or not at all. Some had descriptive labels, and some had to guess what mystery meat or vegetables were offered. Dishes were inconsistently salted.- The wifi was spotty around the property and non-existent at the private beach.- Entertainment could be better, but I guess it's more catered to older folks who make up most of the guests. Enjoyed the Cretan night, though; great music.- Music ended at 11 pm sharp, probably due to the close proximity to the guest rooms at the main pool. - All-inclusive drinks end at 11 pm too.","We had an exceptional stay in the resort. Our goal was to do nothing but enjoy the sun, sea, and food and drinks.. and we got just that. - Clean rooms, exceptional housekeeping, and the views were spectacular. - We were upgraded to the room with the private pool for 2 out of the 5 nights we stayed, and we agreed to move back to the room we originally booked for due to availability. This was all detailed at check-in. It was a lovely experience nonetheless. - There was a main pool, two saltwater pools, a much smaller indoor pool in a separate building at the spa and a kid's pool with a slide. - The hotel's private beach access to the ocean is via two ladders and is unsuitable for folks who can't swim well without aid. The adjacent Mononaftis Beach is rocky but provides a gradual entrance into the sea.- Friendly staff at meal times, always quick to clear empty plates. Shoutout to Bobby, who always greeted us with a smile and hello at every meal. - Lovely public places and many beautiful spots to relax.- Airport transfer was pricey but convenient and punctual.","Beautiful, sea front resort with incredible sea-view rooms.","Double or Twin Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2022","5 nights","Couple","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjX-yvXpfCdoBVY1dlcaLf2m1rTEnDTvRkDmQBCpQ=s96-c","Singapore","Nur"

We had a late check out they ensured we could keep our room to shower etc.
They made you feel that ‘nothing was a problem’
Peninsula is a large hotel and you felt like you could have various experiences around each different place/pool/beach each day.
We enjoyed the facilities around the main pool (close to snack bar/lunch etc) the Tsimento beach platform- beautiful to dive into the water and snorkel (great cocktail and very aesthetically pleasing) and the fresh water pool with lots of space to swim in and lots of sun beds.
You can rent a boat from the beach platform also. This was super easy and cheap!
We visited the small beach with a lovely family run Taverna (copious amounts of Raki and cake provided and was so fun!)
Food within the restaurant was good. Good selection and something for everyone. We went out for dinner and lunch at times to ensure we wasn’t bored.
The property is super clean and friendly. It is a nice mix of child friendly but with a mix of couples and adults.
We didn’t stay for entertainment, so cannot comment.
Agia Pelagia village is a 15 minute hilly walk but ‘doable’ we even walked back from dinner a few times.","Caters for everyone!

Wer ein wenig mehr möchte als nur in der Anlage zu bleiben, dem empfehle ich sich einfach mal trotz Hitze auf den Weg zu machen und die Gegend zu erkunden. Es lohnt sich....
Unten am Strand gibt es eine sehr schöne Taverne mit so herzlichen Gastgebern sehr zu empfehlen.

La plage ne contenait pas de sable, ce qui est très désagréable mais parfait pour la plongée. Beaucoup de marche, certes très présente dans ces milieux montagneux, mais certaines étaient cassés et donc dangereuse.

So war ein Sideboard deutlich gebrochen, sehr wackelig das ganz, sodass man da nichts abstellen wollte. War eben irgendwie zusammengeflickt worden. Es gab einen Kühlschrank im Zimmer. Der war irgendwie im Kleiderschrank untergebracht. Ob das so klug ist, bei der Wärme, die so ein Kühlschrank produziert, halte ich für fraglich.  Essen war 3/5, man musste eben die Meute satt bekommen. Was uns wahnsinnig gestört hat: Getränke aus Pappbechern! Nachhaltig sieht zum einen anders aus und zum andern ist das eher so ein „Kaffee- an der-Tankstelle-Feeling“. Zum Essen dann teilweise so kleine Holzlöffel. Ja-immerhin aus Holz, aber eben auch nur im Einmal-Gebrauch. Die ganze Animation und das Abendprogramm war durchgängig nur auf Französisch… nun, das Hotel wird wohl von nem französischen Cluburlaub-Anbieter angeboten… das erklärt das Ganze zwar, allerdings hätte man sowas auch gerne irgendwie in die Hotelbeschreibung aufnehmen können. Es wird außerdem damit geworben, dass es einen Flughafen-Shuttle gibt. Das ist schlicht und ergreifend falsch. Gibt es nicht. Man sollte sich also ein Taxi für den Weg zum Flughafen organisieren. Und, Achtung: AI ist dort nicht direkt alles AI, wird einem nur nicht erzählt. Beispielsweise die Tsimento-Bar unten an der Badestelle beim Bootsverleih ist nicht inbegriffen. Das muss man wissen, denn zurück zur inkludierten Bar ist es schon etwas weiter mit vielen Treppen. Ist schon irgendwie Abzocke, denn bei den dort herrschenden Temperaturen muss man ja trinken… die Pools schließen außerdem um 18 Uhr. Relativ unschön, wenn man sich abends noch etwas abkühlen möchte.","Die Lage war wunderschön. Unser Zimmer hatte den tollen Meerblick, wo dann auch der Sonnenaufgang zu sehe war. Zimmer waren soweit sauber, Bett sehr bequem. Personal weitestgehend sehr freundlich. Beim Essen wurde täglich variiert. Gut auch, dass nicht bis spät in die Nacht hinein die Musik aufgedreht wird. So wird allen Bedürfnissen Rechnung getragen.","Alles in allem war das ein schöner Urlaub.

Negatives:
- no hair conditioner, which you need after being in the salt water pool or sea
- smallest bottles of shower gel (huge waste of plastic) which wasn't very good quality and scentless. I would recommended bringing your own toiletries.
- The bedding is a sheet and very thin blanket, we had to ask for multiple blankets as the room was freezing at night (without air con), I ended up sleeping under 2x blankets and 2x dressing gowns as I was so cold and there were no duvets. Even with 2x pillows from home, it wasn't very comfortable.
- The corridors are loud in the night when people arrive/leave or come back from a late night. There doesn't seem to be any courtesy by other guests as they stumble in past 11pm.
DRINKS/FOOD:
- The all inclusive cocktails were disgusting - no effort went into them and they were served in basic glasses. Clearly trying to get you to pay for them.
- There seemed to be NO monitoring of all inclusive guests/other boards, anyone could walk in to any meal and pick up food or order at a bar.. we felt a bit like we may have overpaid as everyone seemed to have the same benefits as us?
ATMOSPHERE/ENTERNTAINMENT:
The animation team is French, so all entertainment is in French. Which we didn't mind as an English couple because it wasn't as cringe! But it is very loud and shouty, so you can hear it from your room until it ends at 11pm.
A lot of guests smoked cigarettes, there was no confined area to do this so most evenings ended with my clothes stinking of other peoples cigarettes and smoke blown over you.
We opted to go out for drinks in the evening as it was more relaxing.
SPA:
The spa pool was covered (indoor) and empty, it was also right next to a children's pool with slides, so I can't image it would be very relaxing.
QUAD BIKE SAFARI (from hotel):
they get you off the quads 4-5 times, which is really annoying as we would rather be riding them than standing around in abandoned villages.","ROOM: Sea View Double - An unobstructed view of the sea, 5ft bed, shower room. The bedroom and bathroom were cleaned everyday.ATMOSPHERE:The hotel has mainly French guests. We went during September, so there weren't many children either, mainly babies if any.SWIMMING POOLS:Main pool - by the main restaurant, ​the animation team were around playing music, zumba, aqua-aerobics, games etc. The main pool is INCREDIBLY deep, at 5ft 3 I couldn't touch the floor at any part of the pool which meant I could take part in aqua-aerobics as I was just fighting to stay afloat the entire time!Salt Water Pool - this is great, less busy as there isn't a bar on this level. Again it is VERY deep, but has a little plunge pool by it.SEA ACCESS:Best feature. Concrete was was brilliant (no sand!), stair access to the sea.Tsimento Bar has really friendly staff and plays better music than main pool. Umbrellas and sun loungers provided free, able to sunbathe all day until sunsets.FOOD:We were impressed, especially for the price, large variety at each meal, rarely repeated meals. Always traditional greek food on offer, seafood night and the other themed nights were good fun too.DRINKS:the paid for cocktails (c. 10€) were really good, all inclusive wine and beer were ok.Local bar - Yamas on the walk to Agia Pelagia was great, brilliant views and well priced cocktails (a lot better than hotels free/paid for drinks)SPA:Massages were great, Maria and the other masseuse gave a good service.EXCURSIONS:Jennifer the customer liaison officer was brilliant, she is fluent in 4 languages! (English, French, German and Greek) She organised us a full day boat trip to Dia Island and also recommended a few places to visit as we rented a car; Chania, Knossos Palace. There is also a quad bike safari that leaves from the hotel and goes into the mountains.","Good value for money, especially if you do own thing and stay away from the main crowd","Double or Twin Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2021","11 nights","Couple","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-t/7eb52a437de4a380f7666d4a62da6e64294cd321.png","United Kingdom","Tabitha"

Also, for 7 days of rest, 2 small packs of orange juice were delivered only 3 times out of 7. Not sure why don’t we got the juice other times.
There is not enough mosquito netting on the balcony, a lot of insects fly into the room at night if you like to sleep with opened balcony.
All swimming pools close at 18:00, it is very early for a beach holiday, we would like them to be closed at least at 20:00.
Check-in at 15:00 is very late, taking into account that at 11:00 check-out from the room.
Nobody changes beach towels, if you want to change them you need to pay 2 euros apiece.
The barbecue chef does not grill kebabs enough, often raw meat (pork!), which is very dangerous, We would like the chef to be more attentive.
The soup is the same every day.","I and my wife rested in this hotel for a week. Long story short: clean rooms, a lot of food, good drinks, there are 3 pools (one of them is with sea water), a very big and wonderful view on all the hotel territory, mountains and clean sea.
We took the simplest room with a garden view. Our plane arrived at 3 am and at 4 am we were already at the hotel. We booked a transfer from the hotel in advance. We were greeted with a sign, very quickly and comfortably delivered to the hotel, a one-way transfer costs 40 euros (for a maximum of 4 people). Check-in is only at 15:00, it is very late. We were lucky because the hotel management had the opportunity to check in for free at 4 am instead of 3 pm. Also as I understand we were upgraded for free to the sea view apartments. Thank you very much for this to the managers and receptionist, we are very grateful. The room was clean, staff did cleaning every day, changed bed linen and towels in the room, brought 2 bottles of water. Additional slippers are provided, which were even changed after 5 days, bathrobes, beach towels also. In the dining room, you need to wear a mask, handle your hands and wear disposable gloves. The food was varied, as for all inclusive in Europe, but not always tasty, this is for everyone to his own taste. Pizzaiolo makes the most delicious pizza we've ever tasted in our life. (P.s. thank you very much a man who did this wonderful pizza). We liked the Delicious fresh juices for breakfast.  Once a week, there was a seafood dinner. Also couple of times we had Greek traditional dished on a dinner.  There is an entertainment program every evening: karaoke, comedy shows, etc. Hotel had an own souvenir shop on the territory, but there are also other souvenir shops within walking distance (on one of the beaches).","Wonderful","Double or Twin Room with Mountain View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2021","7 nights","Couple","https://xx.bstatic.com/xdata/images/xphoto/square64/97712308.jpg?k=6616622f20e290bef7f64bf239b8b81127ca601d01feff2e8a185b20fdeb80d6&o=","Ukraine","Yevhenii"

The pool area became quite busy at times due to being close to the all inclusive bars, but it was easy to escape the main pool area like we did and chill elsewhere.","Beautiful location, friendly staff and buffet food options were fantastic! Jennifer, the customer relations officer was lovely and helped us book in for our Quad bike safari (definitely a must do). It was a lovely first impression to be welcomed personally to the resort by Jennifer on our first evening. The Tsimento beach bar was our favourite place to chill right next to the crystal clear waters. The sun beds at this bar were included in the all inclusive booking but the drinks at this bar weren’t (all inclusive bars were close to the main pool) - however we didn’t mind as the cocktails from the bar were delicious (particularly the Athenian Spritz). The whole resort was spotless and it was lovely to come back to our room in the afternoon all clean with fresh water and orange juice in the mini fridge and clean beach towels.

I'd suggest reinforcing some sort of check to avoid this situation.

Bring back ouzo! :)Sometimes food was too salty.","Always a pleasure to return to this hotel.

I shouldn’t have to go all the way back up the top for a rum and coke. Also snacks should have been available to guests at same said bar as part of the all inclusive package, such as sandwiches, bbq etc. No bar at salt water pool, again quite a walk to get a drink etc.  In the main restaurant only some of the food had labels on so you had no clue what some of it was.","Like most people say the food is really good.

1) they didn’t book us a taxi transfer from port on arrival despite we communicated and requested this with them via bookings; when we called from port they did arrange one to pick us up then but communication wasn’t excellent. No apologies whatsoever.
2) the hotel gets the bulk of its guests from non English speaking EU countries but not from the Uk so a lot of staff don’t speak good English. This includes one of the two reception ladies unfortunately (who was also not very courteous/friendly for a receptionist at an entertainment place) A lot of junior staff around - cleaning rooms and restaurants etc - who are all nice, but you rarely see any managers onsite who knows the stuff when you needed to ask questions slightly out of ordinary.
Hotel is on a cliff, there are two beaches nearby but we hadn’t realized it until we arrived that the beaches are tiny and pebbly, they aren’t hotels private beaches and the hotel doesn’t operate on the beaches at all (ie no hotel beds or bar etc). This was disappointing.
The hotel has two main swimming pools plus a small toddler pool with a couple of slides and a small indoor swimming pool by the spa. One of the main swimming pool is salt water pool - don’t really see the point of this as if I want to swim in salt water I’d go to the sea. Pool can be a refreshing change from the sea as it’s not salt water!  So this leaves one main pool for most guests. the pool’s shallow end is still too deep at prob 1.5m and goes deeper rapidly so most adults can only stand in a very small part of the pool. Also loud music all day by the pool. After a couple of days we went to the small toddler pool (we have no toddlers) instead when no one is there. One of the slide of the toddler pool doesn’t work but no one came to fix it over the entire 8 days we were there. We didn’t need to use it so ok.","Food was not bad for a buffet. Dinner menus are changed daily and sometimes they put up a theme night. We are family of four stayed in a two bedrooms room. Rooms seemed newly refurbished and are clean. Beds are comfortable.

"gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia","d0580ea0cf7d913d",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"7.0","June 25, 2023","de","93","","Ein paar Infos vorweg:
Diese Bewertung bezieht sich auf die exakte Buchung, die wir vollzogen haben (Zimmer, All-Inclusive...). Würde ich nur die Hotelanlage an sich bewerten, würde sie besser ausfallen.
Wir sind ein Studenten-Paar, haben beide vor kurzer Zeit unsere Abschlussarbeit eingereicht und zufällig fällt unser Jahrestag in den gleichen Zeitraum. Wir haben uns hier also mal richtig was gegönnt, was eigentlich gar nicht so unbedingt in unserem Budget liegt. Durch diesen Punkt muss ich einige Aspekte sehr kritisch hinterfragen...
Die Buchung wie wir sie durchgeführt haben, ist leider ein Witz. - ""All-Inclusive"" bedeutet in diesem Hotel Zugang zu einer Snackbar zu haben, die nur bis 17:00 Uhr besetzt ist (in diesem Zeitraum fanden bereits 2 Mahlzeiten am Tag statt) und liebloses Fingerfood wie Hotdogs oder schlecht zubereitete Cocktails anbietet (die Cocktails sind entweder viel zu stark oder viel zu sehr mit Wasser verdünnt. Man kriegt das Gefühl, schlechte Longdrinks zu konsumieren. Mit Cocktails hat das wenig zu tun). Die Anlage verfügt über 2 weitere Bars, die nicht vom All-Inclusive Angebot abgedeckt sind (?). Im Speisesaal interessiert sich niemand dafür, ob du eine Halbpension gebucht hast oder Geld für All-Inclusive ausgegeben hast; nicht falsch verstehen - ich habe mich für die Leute sehr gefreut, trotzdem ist das ein Punkt an dem wir hätten Geld sparen können - und dieser Aspekt wird sich weiter durch diese Bewertung ziehen.
Da wir uns richtig was gönnen wollten, haben wir uns für das Zimmer mit Privatpool entschieden...Als wir in dieses Zimmer reingekommen sind, konnten wir unser Glück zunächst kaum glauben. Das Zimmer und insbesondere der Balkon mit dem großen Pool und dessen Aussicht aufs Meer ist unbeschreiblich schön.
- Leider wird das Wasser im Pool nicht aufgewärmt, sodass das Wasser eiskalt ist und es für mich unmöglich gemacht hat, den Pool zu verwenden.","Einige positive Aspekte:
- Das Essen ist ein Traum. Es gibt jeden(!) Tag neue Gerichte, eine gigantische Auswahl von hausgemachten ""Fast-Food-Gerichten"" á la Pommdöner bis hin zur Meeresplatte aus der Haute Cuisine. Die Getränkeauswahl ist ausreichend, wenn auch nicht überwältigend. Der Nachtisch ist ebenfalls sehr ansprechend, abwechslungsreich und lecker.
- Die Hotelanlage und insbesondere dessen Lage an sich ist traumhaft. Wer beim Buchen einige Euro mehr in die Hand nimmt und sich für ein Zimmer mit Meerblick entscheidet wird definitiv nicht enttäuscht werden; die Hotelanlage ist nahezu direkt am Meer gelegen (siehe Bilder des Resorts hier auf booking.com) - man hört je nach Wellengang das Meer bis ins Zimmer. Die Anlage ist sehr sauber und gepflegt. Das Personal (insbesondere Rezeption) ist hilfsbereit, freundlich und zuvorkommend. Ich kann hier kein schlechtes Wort verlieren.
- Das Abendprogramm ist abwechslungsreich, wenn auch nicht optimal (siehe oben) gestaltet. - Die Kids-Disko sowie generell der Umgang mit Familien und Kindern, ausgehend vom Personal, ist mir persönlich - auch wenn es uns nicht betroffen hat - sehr positiv in Erinnerung geblieben.

Kinderdisco war einmal, was für unsere Tochter mehr als traurig war. als wir nachfragten erhielten wir eher eine patzige Antwort.
Negativ war für uns auch alles auf Französisch, wenn es mal ein Programm gab. (eher blieb es abends ruhig). Die Gäste waren auf sich gestellt.
Essen war oft kalt, alles gegrillte war schwarz u schmeckte einfach nur verbrannt. Störend war für uns auch die Hygiene! Es wurde alles mit einen Lappen abgewischt. Gläser bzw. Tassen waren verschmutzt u wenn sie alle waren, wurde selten nachgefüllt. Man trank sein Kaffee dann früh aus Pappbecher. Inclusivgetränke  konnte man teilweise nicht trinken,
Man fühlte sich leider nicht als Gast willkommen.
Negativ fanden wir auch den Strand. Hier wurde tolle Liegen, ein Bar angepriesen. Liegen waren leider so wenig, dass man sich teilweise auf die Steine setzen musste. Bar war geschlossen, der untere Pool war komplett zu / warum, hat uns keiner mitgeteilt! Einen Tag vor unser Abreise, sind wir zur Rezeption um alles zu bezahlen. Wir teilten der Dame mit, dass wir
früh 4.30 Uhr abreisen. Es wurde weder nachgefragt, ob wir etwas zu essen mitnehmen möchten, noch wie es uns gefallen hat. Leider fühlte man sich ""null"" willkommen. Das ganze Hotel ist sehr Französisch ausgerichtet, man sollte sich dies bewusst sein, wenn man die Unterkunft bucht. Ganz furchtbar fanden wir die Animation bzw. die Personen, die es ausführten. Kinder sind hier eher nicht willkommen, so unser Eindruck. Schade. wir können gar nicht verstehen, dass dies als fabelhaft angepriesen wird.","Der mega Ausblick, tolle Bucht, mit einen schönen Blick wenn die Sonne aufgeht. Zimmer war sehr geräumig.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your rating and valuable feedback. We would just like to share with you that the hotel does have solar panels, they are located on the terrace of the main building. The food waste from the main restaurant is collected and given to the pigs of Fodele village. Our kitchen staff has also been trained extensively in cooking with as minimal waste as possible. We are also in the process of introducing a one card policy per room but decided to exempt family rooms. All the flyers and collateral you mention are currently being updated - everything will be in place next season! On the info guide / map provided upon arrival, we also state that towels are not changed daily and that if guests want to change their towels, they should leave them in the sink or floor. If they were changed daily, it was most probably a misguided attempt by the housekeeping staff to provide better service. We will discuss and explain that this is not correct. We are generally aiming to improve our environmental policy. Hopefully, you will see an improvement next time you visit!

Kaum Angaben ob vegan/vegetarisch oder ob Schwein enthalten ist. Unbedingt anschreiben! Einzelne Gruppen, konnten (ohne offiziellen Aufpreis) Tische an den besten Plätzen reservieren. Diese Tische wurden lange nicht genutzt und Gäste die früher kommen, dürfen sich mit der zweiten Reihe begnügen (Foto).  Das Personal war nicht wirklich aufmerksam oder freundlich. Deutsch wurde auch nicht gesprochen.Bar: obwohl gelegentlich bis zu 3 Angestellte anwesend waren, bediente lediglich eine Person hinter der Bar, was oft zu grösseren Warteschlangen führte. AI Longdrinks (bekanntlich) qualitativ schwach und minimalistisch hergerichtet.Kinder kommen zu wenig auf ihre Kosten. Es fehlt bspw. ein Kinder-Buffet. Mini-Disco wurde lieblos 15min abgehalten (obwohl 30min angekündigt). Die Pools sind für kleinere Kinder zu tief und eine Aufsicht gab es nie. Der Kinderpool liegt ausserhalb der Anlage, mit wenig Liegen und Schirme für die Eltern. Getränke gab es dort auch keine. Zwei Rutschen und fertig (Foto). Wir haben viel Zeit am Strand verbracht, weil die Pools nicht wirklich geeignet waren, länger dort in Ruhe zu verweilen. Mit kleineren Kindern (<8 Jahren) ist dieses Hotel, welches sich familienfreundlich bezeichnet, nicht zu empfehlen. Auch der AI Service sehen wir als unterdurchschnittlich im Vergleich zu anderen Hotels. Für uns stimmte Preis/Leistung keineswegs.","Es handelt sich hierbei um ein schönes, sauberes und modernes frankofreundliches Hotel mit drei einfachen Pools, mit zu wenig Liegen und Schirmen.

A notre arrivée, l'accueil semblait débordée par le nombre de visiteurs. Les valises restent dans l'entrée pendant de longues heures et le pauvre bagagiste ne savait plus où donner de la tête...
Nous sommes finalement parvenus à rentrer dans notre chambre qui empestait le tabac froid à notre grand désarroi ! Nous avons dormi la fenêtre ouverte car ne supportant pas cet air.
Dans les parties communes, cet hôtel est une vraie usine et l'on peut le découvrir au ""buffet-restaurant"" qui s'apparente plus à une cantine où tout le monde se précipite pour manger de la nourriture basique et très peu qualitative !! Très très décevant !! :(
La quantité ne fait pas la qualité !!!

Non ho apprezzato particolarmente il resto del cibo, ma non sono un palato facile da soddisfare, gli altri ospiti che ho conosciuto lo hanno reputato buono.  Nel golfo sotto l'hotel c'è un ristotantino famigliare, dove si mangia veramente bene lo consiglio si chiama Vasilis. La camera non rispecchiava ciò che avevo prenotato, ma la vista sul golfo si faceva perdonare almeno parzialmente le inesattezze riscontrate.

Ensure kids (under 9-10 years) are not serving themselves food alone; there were a few mishaps that could be cause for contamination, etc. 3. AC units to be regularly cleaned and checked. 4. Wifi speed and coverage could be improved in common areas such as reception, dining and pool areas.","The staff (all- reception, cleaning, food, and beverage, guest services, spa staff) are exceptionally professional and welcoming. The views are incredible and a superb place for unwinding and relaxing! At this time of the pandemic, having in-house PCR / rapid testing facilities was a huge convenience. The resort itself is a HUGE venue and has many activities to do every night/ day. It is a great place for couples, solos, families- for everyone as a matter of fact. This is the first time to stay at one venue for over 10 nights (all-inclusive) and truly enjoyed the experience. I highly recommend renting the boat for a few hours and sailing across the 33 km coastal beaches. There was a variety of cusines which was very local and international all at the same time. The live BBQ/grill stations, pizza, desserts and pasta/eggs stations were incredible. Every day and nights, the meals are very tasty and yummy :).  Never a day was stressful or boring - it was pure bliss and peaceful.","Pure bliss and peaceful resort!","Superior Double Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","August 2021","10 nights","Couple","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-d/bebbb1d5ff29328157080e4e2e5d15a29c5aa34a.png","United Arab Emirates","Dr"

There are many luxurious hotels around, but none of them has access to the beach. At Peninsula you have direct access to the public beach, and on the other side another  access where you can just walk down and jump straight to the water. It is cristal clear and beautiful, especially for snorkeling.
If you like to swim and dive , this is the place to be! And above all, what makes a big difference is the customer service.
Big big thank you to all the staff and especially to Georgia at the reception, and Mister who works night shifts at the reception.
They have been so kind, helpful, always with the smile. Whatever you may need - there is no problem.  Truly appreciated!
You made our vacaciones very pleasant.

The 'cocktails' are coming from a machine and is really horrible quality, I have never, ever seen anything like that in my life before. This machine is like in fast food restaurants where you can refill your soft drink, but here they used it for the drinks with 'alcohol' (I doubt it had anything in it besides sugar to be honest). At the beach bar you can have decent drinks and lovely service, but it is not included in the all inclusive package. Absolutely not worth it. Snacks are basically non-existent. Any guest can freely use a soft drink/water machine throughout the day, so don't book all inclusive.","- the location itself is stunning- colleagues at the reception are lovely and helpful, also at the beach bar- you can rent smaller boats on the private beach without a license, try it if you can, it is really worth it!","Lovely location and view, horrible all inclusive package","Superior Double Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","June 2023","7 nights","Couple","https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9IAKMyP__kM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABGE/gbu7kHpRflw/photo.jpg?sz=50","Switzerland","Zsuzsa"

Animation team/entertainment was absolutely diabolical. All French, no coordination, no routine/choreography. That same song being played everyday 3 x a day was a nightmare.
Tuesday night had a jazz sax night upstairs in the bar where you are required to pay. He was phenomenal with a good variation of songs being played but it was unfortunately quite quiet. I don't know if this is because you have to pay at this bar, or if it's not advertised well enough. There should be more nights like this but I don't agree with this bar being required to pay for drinks!
The decking by the main pool/restaurant is lifted in areas and a trip hazard. I'm surprised no one has fallen and complained. It appears old and slightly rotting. The steps leading into the main pool need scrubbing in the corners, they are yellow. But besides that the pool itself is amazing and very clean. Great size, lots of sunbeds to choose from without that typical sunbed fight of a morning you might expect in all inclusive hotels.
The drinks within the all inclusive package are awful. The beer either too flat or too gassy but never a perfect pint. The wine is very yellow and sweet. The lemon soda is also lacking in taste. My partner paid for cans of beer from the mini-market by the beach instead not what you expect to be doing during an all inclusive holiday.
The toilets near the main restaurant are disgusting. The door handles barely work on the cubicles. One actually fell off in my hand, fortunately I hadn't locked the door and didn't become trapped.
The silver pedal bin doesn't open when pressed with the pedal you have to manly open it with your hands which is not hygienic. That's only if you're lucky enough for their to be hand paper towels in the dispenser, mostly it was empty and the hand dryer didn't work either.","The all inclusive food has been great. Excellent choice and variation every morning/lunch/tea. We visited the Al a carte restaurant on Monday evening, the food was all lovely and well presented. The atmosphere was also beautiful, the only downside being you could hear that god awful animation music downstairs and on arrival there was a table with to young children and the children were running up and down the restaurant which I don't agree with.
We stayed in room 226 which had a lovely view of one of the nearby beaches and was on the same floor as the restaurant & pool - perfect given I was heavily pregnant during our stay.
The pool area was beautiful, as where the beaches. But I don't agree with paying for beds at an all inclusive!p","Lovely facilities & food, predominantly French hotel (speaking and guests).

Für Ältere Menschen auf jeden Fall sehr schwierig gerade bei 50 Grad. War aber nicht direkt ein Problem bei uns. Das was mich etwas verärgert hat, waren zwei Sachen. 1. Die Getränkeauswahl bei All Inclusive ist sehr sehr sehr gering. Also es gibt Softgetränke, wasser, Bier, Wein und 5 Longdrinks die leider nicht hochwertig sind, also ich habe jeder dieser 5 gekostet und ich hatte das Gefühl ich trinke nichts Gutes. Zudem kommt, daß man diese nur ganz oben am Hauptpool beim Restaurant bekommt, also da wo man sich normalerweise nicht befinden möchte weil ab 11 Uhr die Animation auf französisch anfängt und viele Kids sind. Der schönste Ort ist die Tsimento Bar ganz unten an der Klippe, mit einem Einstieg ins Meer. Da kriegt man aber leider keine Longdrinks und die All inklusive Gäste auch nur bis 17.30 Uhr Getränke. Also alles in einem lohnt sich All Inclusive nicht, ich habe durch meinen Job schon sehr oft All inklusive gehabt und noch nie so eine schlechte Auswahlt gehabt. Im Restaurant fragt dich keiner nach deinem Zimmer, d.h. auch mit Halbpension kann man rein und raus spazieren und sich bei den Getränken bedienen.
2. Das erste Zimmer welches wir bekommen haben, hatte eine schöne Lage (722) aber wurde sogar von der Reinigungskraft als Problemzimmer bezeichnet. Die Balkontür ging nicht zu und dadurch ging die Klimaanlage nicht an. Die Klimaanlage war eh kaputt stellte sich dann später heraus. Also das Zimmer ist bekannt als Problemzimmer und wird einem trotzdem gegeben. Nach einer Nacht in Hitze haben wir am nächsten Tag ein anderes Zimmer bekommen, wo alles funktionierte. Uns kam es so vor, als ob die gehofft haben das wir uns nicht beschweren..Allgemein waren wir öfter an der Rezeption,  obwohl ich mich nie so oft beschwere, und jedes Mal als wir da waren waren Paare vor uns die sich auch beschwerten, meistens wegen Zimmern.","Der Service, also das Personal, war immer sehr nett und hat versucht zu helfen. Also der eine mehr als der andere. Das Hotel hat sich auf Franzosen spezialisiert und deshalb ist das meiste französisch, aber war uns egal weil wir eh die Shows nicht so gut fanden. Im Hotel gibt es eine Ansprechpartnerin, die auch deutsch kann, sie findet man meistens an der Rezeption und sie kümmert sich um die Ausflüge. Gut war das Angebot Für 3.50 eur nach Heraklion zu kommen, guter Pluspunkt für einen günstigen Ausflug. Hätte auch schon auf der Internetseite präsentiert werden können.
Das Essen war oft auch sehr gut.","Good","Double or Twin Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","August 2021","6 nights","Group","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-s/d321d61d78a8fa310843e1967dca38e6276b92aa.png","Germany","Sandra"

La mia opinione e di evitarlo, è un resort che punta tutto sulla scarsa qualità di ogni cosa! La mia prenotazione era per una junior suite ma sinceramente di suite non c’era nulla. Dalla descrizione alla realtà sembra di essere in un altro hotel non so dove abbiano preso le 4 stelle! Pessima stanza, con un bagno orrendo e puzzolente di fogna persino le saponette per il viso ( Made in China ), doccia orrenda che schizza tutta acqua fuori! Se fate all-inclusive dimenticatevi di mangiare bene se poi per voi è più importante la quantità che la qualità allora va bene! Tutti prodotti low-cost da discount! Ah dimenticavo non aspettatevi di avere tutto all-inclusive!!! La spiaggia è una piazzola di cemento dove camminarci a piedi scalzi e impossibile e se vi posizionate accanto il noleggio barche allora sembra di stare accanto un pompa di benzina dalla puzza!!! ombrelloni che in Italia li usavamo 30 anni fa ( senza un minimo di protezione UV ) e sdraio scomodissime! Molti problemi con la reception dove sono molto scortesi e menefreghisti e non sono stati in grado di aiutarci a risolvere il nostro problema nonostante anche il proprietario fosse stato informato anche lui non ha provveduto a fare nulla! ( per non infangare ancora di più questo resort evito di raccontare questa vicenda).

Our toilet room made a noise, and the airconditioner expelled a very bad smell, I think it was just us.
We didn’t liked some guests, not the hotel fault, but some pepople complained for stupid things like a woman was in the reception saying that she had water on her hear! Other getting upset because she wasn't served at her table when on a buffet you have to go and get your food! Again about the clients, too much kids crying and screaming, so not the best on this time of the year for just a couple, it looked so peaceful and exclusive on pictures that the reality of the fully booked season by mostly families was disappointing.
The shower broke but it was replaced super fast, 30 min I would say.
We asked to kill some flies that were on the light, they did but didn’t clean so the flies bodies stayed on the lamp as roommates for the rest of the stay, no glamour at all.","- The view from our room was spectacular
- Sea salt beach was nice but the access to the sea was the best, bring an inflatable device so you don’t get tired of floating there
- Food offered a huge variety every time only good in general, but the seafood night and the greek night the food was absolutely great
- staff was good, they were so busy all the time, specially at the reception I hope they can have some rest, they really deserve it.
- Just 30 min taxi to airport, it has taxies to everywhere so is easy to go places, if you are here, visit Agya Pelagya, or the Waterpark if you buy tickets online they will pickup you there and return you to the hotel, super easy.
- super economical buses to Heraklion, just 3.5 euros
- rent a car just across the street, get one and go to Rethymno for a night or visit  the lake.
- offers different activities and options to swim, many different locations for pictures!
- we got great memories here, Crete is a beautiful island, nearby tavernas offer exquisite food, next time I will not get all inclusive so I will go more to dine out and get all possible tastes.","Peninsula was good in general","Double or Twin Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","August 2021","11 nights","Couple","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IXgFT6PkVE8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACU/xYOy9fCXlcg/photo.jpg","United States of America","Axel"

La vue, où que l'on soit est dingue.
Les chambres sont très propres (nous avions une chambre familiale vue mer avec 2 ""chambres"").
Les repas sont très bons et variés.
Le personnel est super (spéciale dédicace aux animateurs Heliades qui ont éclaté nos enfants toutes la semaine).
Il y en a pour tous les goûts : piscine, ponton de l'hôtel ou plage.
Nous avons eu de la chance, nous avons eu une belle semaine et avons pu nous baigner tous les jours.
Je conseille vraiment cet hôtel.","Peninsula en famille at la Toussaint","Superior Double Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","October 2022","7 nights","Family","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-d/bebbb1d5ff29328157080e4e2e5d15a29c5aa34a.png","France","Delphine"

Но семьям с детьми до 10 лет примерно - нет отдельных детских зон - только отдельный бассейн с морской водой 75 см. Просто примечание, так как для семей с более старшими детками все прекрасно!Интернет отеля перегружен, особо на него не расчитывайте. Добраться до отеля на городском транспорте невозможно - только такси/трансфер/пешком (очень долго). Но это скорее плюс отеля!","Много лет были поклонниками и постоянными гостями друго отеля в Амударе, но в этот раз решили попробовать Peninsula и не ошиблись! Прекрасный видовый отель - везде наслаждение видами на море и горы. Бассейны с морской водой и снова с видом на прекрасное критское море и Крит. Кухня на любой вкус! Волшебные море продукты, волшебный гриль! Номера просторные - наша семья из 4х человек в двухкомнатном номере чувствовала себя комфортно и нестесненно. Вид из номера обалденный - море и горы, красивейшие бухты, все оттенки лазури. Кровати удобные, спать сладко! Кондиционер работает хорошо. Анимация отличная и ненавязчивая.

Es gibt einen kleinen Abstellraum, wo man Kleidung aufhängen kann, aber keine Regale oder Schränke.
Leider ist die Animation fast ausschließlich nur auf Französisch und kaum Englisch erfolgt. Das hat sehr vielen Gästen nicht gefallen, da man sich ausgegrenzt gefühlt hat. Sicher ist dies sehr leicht zu ändern.","Die Lage des Resort ist fantastisch. Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Meerblick und das war einfach nur traumhaft. Die vielen Liegemoeglichkeiten an den unterschiedlichen Plätzen ( Meerwasserpool, Strand, am Restaurant u.a.) bieten entspannte Rückzugsgebiete. Man hat so kaum gemerkt, dass das Hotel sehr gut besucht ist.
Im Restaurant findet man zu jeder Zeit Platz und das Essen ist sehr lecker und für jeden Geschmack etwas dabei.
Das Personal ist sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und umsichtig. Unser Taxitransfer z.B. vom Flughafen zum Hotel und zurück wurde  problemlos organisiert. Wir kamen abends spät und und konnten sogar noch Abendessen.  Außerdem erhielten wir Textnachrichten vom Empfang mit Informationen und der Frage, ob alles zu unserer Zufriedenheit ist.
Die Sportangebote wie Yoga, Fitness, Zumba und Volleyball nutzen wir auch. Man kann noch Tischtennis und Basketball spielen.
Am Hotel ist besteht die Möglichkeit zu einem Bootsausflug. Das kann man sehr empfehlen.
Der kleine Ort selbst ist in 20 min zu erreichen und einen Besuch wert.","Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen und können das Hotel nur weiterempfehlen.","Junior Suite with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","May 2022","5 nights","Family","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-j/f69a0f45af414641ac0371c1f139c49637969c6c.png","Germany","Jana"

Als Deutscher ist es ein ziemlicher Kulturclash ;) Aber hier geht es vermutlich mehr um die Zufriedenheit der Masse und das sind nun mal die Gäste aus Frankreich - die Gäste sind wirklich sonst durchweg bunt gemischt was Alter angeht und die Herkunft. Also die restlichen ca 50%.
Sonst absolut nichts!","Das Resort ist riesig! Man findet mehrere Ecken, wo man nicht aufeinander hockt, wenn man will. Natürlich kann man sich auch am Hauptpool treiben lassen…es gibt unglaublich viele unterschiedliche Zimmertypen! Hier ist wirklich für jeden etwas dabei. Sehr sauber, gepflegt - man merkt richtig, dass das housekeeping da gerne arbeitet und sich gerne um die Anlage kümmert. Man kann jeden Wunsch kommunizieren und man versucht diesen falls möglich umzusetzen.
Zum Essen: es wird wirklich viel Abwechslung geboten. Es ist für jeden was dabei! Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass hier jemand nicht fündig wird. Wenn man kommuniziert, dass man ggf Unverträglichkeiten hat - geht man darauf ein. Auch als Veganer findet man immer etwas. Natürlich ist es aber keine auf vegane Ernährung spezialisierte Küche - da gibt es aber extra Hotels, die das anbieten.
Zu den Drinks: ich kann nicht nachvollziehen was kritisiert wird. Habe einige Longdrinks und Cocktails von der all inclusive Karte getestet und alle waren trinkbar und lecker. Meine Empfehlung ist der ouzo mit Eis und Wasser ;)
Spa habe ich nicht getestet und habe auch keine Hotel organisierten Ausflüge gemacht. Das Wetter war zu schön für Bus und Cremes.
Das Service Team ist supernett und sehr zuvorkommend. Alles in allem wirklich toll! Auch dass man 3 Strände hat im Umfeld, die man erkunden kann.

То есть 1 раз и для поездки в 4 дня, и в 14. Хотелось бы, чтобы были более логичные правила, например, раз в неделю. Следующее посещение стоит уже 40 евро с человека, что на наш взгляд неоправданно дорого для меню ресторана. Также было бы здорово видеть очень вкусные вафли с ужина и на завтрак. Дополнительно из еды огорчили коктейли, которые не входят в all inclusive и стоят по 8-11 евро за штуку: невкусные, не особо красивые и явно не стоят таких денег.
2) Море и пляж: в одном из предыдущих отзывов читала, что на пляже нет спасателей и спасательных кругов. Так вот, круги появились, но дежурного спасателя все ещё нет. С учётом того, что море глубокое, со скалами вокруг и не самым простым входом и выходом, наличие дежурного спасателя было бы уместно.
3) Номер: за время пребывания в отеле успели пожить в двух номерах, в первом все было хорошо, а во втором была очень странная кровать: основание как будто каменное, чуть ли не высеченное из пола и стен, ночью приходилось сползать ниже и класть барьер из подушек чтобы случайно не удариться головой о камень
4) Услуги отеля: очень огорчило отсутствие прачечной в отеле. Хотя и взяли достаточно вещей, за две недели все равно появляется потребность в стирке. Пришлось идти пешком с крутыми спусками и подъёмами в соседнюю деревню по 33градусной жаре (возможно, если вы будете брать машину в аренду, это не будет проблемой). Также очень слабый wi fi, в номере, в лобби и около баров ловит хорошо, но стоит спуститься вниз к бассейну и пляжу, связь почти полностью пропадает","1) Еда: достаточно разнообразная, за две недели успела поднадоесть только к концу проживания. Особенно вкусные завтраки, в том числе свежевыжатый апельсиновый сок (включен бесплатно только в пакете all inclusive, в остальных кажется 2 или 3 евро за стакан), омлет, хашбрауны (к сожалению, только раз в неделю). Достаточно свежие овощи и фрукты, разнообразие горячего: рыба, мясо, курица. Десерты стандартные, обычные по вкусу - бисквиты, муссы, желе, пахлава. Вино и пиво средние, но для нас было не принципиально, так как почти не пьем алкоголь.
2) Море и пляж: собственного песчаного пляжа у отеля нет, но для нас это оказалось скорее плюсом. Не прилипает песок, нет грязи, водорослей. Вода кристально чистая, спуск по ступенькам сразу на глубину, по ощущениям глубина метра 3-4. Очень красивый цвет воды, вокруг плавают рыбки. Лучше взять маску или очки, чтобы насладиться плаванием. Волн за все время практически не было, море спокойное и теплое. Лежаки сначала были в достатке, но когда приехало больше людей, стало не хватать. Лучше приходить пораньше до завтрака, чтобы занять место.
3) Территория отеля: очень большая, просторная, красивая и зелёная территория. Отель выполнен в светлых тонах и расположен на скале, что в сочетании с синим морем очень напоминает Санторини. Сразу скажу, что для людей с ограниченными возможностями, пожилых людей и для гостей с маленькими детьми (особенно с колясками) отель может не подойти: спуск к нижнему бассейну и морю только частично возможен на лифте, а затем нужно преодолеть много достаточно крутых многоуровневых ступенек.
Есть бесплатные теннисные корты, столы для настольного тенниса, баскетбольная площадка.
4) Расположение отеля: отель находится на скале с очень красивыми видами на горы и море, каждый день ходит несколько автобусов в Ираклион и обратно (3.5 евро с человека в один конец).","Хороший отель, идеальное море и красивая территория","","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2021","12 nights","Couple","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-a/2c7be68fb3f987f1352e7b289d4b24137e1a283d.png","Russia","Anonymous"

Shoutout to the animation team! Although they mainly talk French, they were very friendly, making guests feel as part of “the family”. They organised both day and evening activities suitable for all ages and they were particularly careful towards kids, including them in their activities. Guests can always approach them and talk English.
The resort staff was also very friendly and helpful. We asked for a late check out and we were offered another room for our last day which we were able to keep until our departure time, which was at 18:00. This was free of charge and greatly appreciated as we had very late flights.
Please note there is a bus leaving from the resort to Heraklion and the other way around. One must pay only €3.5 for the bus ticket and the bus departs from the resort on a daily basis at specific times. Simply ask at the reception and they will provide you with the schedule. Don’t book cabs to leave the resort as the price is €45 for a half an hour trip.","Overall it was a great experience! 🩵","Superior Double Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2023","5 nights","Group","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-a/2c7be68fb3f987f1352e7b289d4b24137e1a283d.png","Austria","Alexandra-florina"

- kein Meerblick
- Keine Trennwand von unserem Balkon zu den Nachbarbalkonen
- Die anderen Gäste gingen oft bei unserem Balkon vorbei, da sie den Weg zum Meer nicht fanden.
Fazit: Keine Privatsphäre!
Wir haben dann auf Nachfrage ein Upgrade zum Zimmer mit privaten Pool erhalten! Die Rezeptionistinnen waren da sehr zuvorkommend.
Fazit dieses Zimmers: Auf jedenfall MIT Pool buchen!!!! Die Hoteleigenen Pools sind teilweise sehr überfüllt. So hat man immer die Möglichkeit, sich zurückzuziehen und sich in Ruhe zu sonnen.
* Die öffentlichen WC's lassen sich NICHT zusperren!!! Das war für uns sehr verwirrend. Auf Nachfrage bei der Rezeption sagte man uns, dass das präventiv gemacht wurde, weil sich in der Vergangenheit viele Kinder selbst eingesperrt hatten.... Ich finde, diesen Grund könnte man auf den WC-Türen anbringen, damit man nicht denkt, es handelt sich um derart alte oder schon kaputte Türen....
* Die Rezeptionistinnen waren teilweise eher unfreundlich.
-> Bezüglich WC-Türen: Die Dame bei der Rezeption meinte zu mir, man soll einfach am besten zu zweit aufs WC gehen. Doch wie soll mich mein Partner am Damen-WC begleiten?!
Noch dazu habe ich in der Nähe des Restaurants und den dort öffentlichen WC's 'Day use Rooms' entdeckt. Die Rezeptionistin hätte mich darüber auch informieren können!!! Bei diesen Räumen lässt sich alles unproblematisch zusperren. Diese wurden dann von uns genützt. Der Weg vom Restaurant zum Zimmer - nur für einen WC-Besuch - ist dann doch sehr weit.....
-> Der Spa Bereich hatte geschlossen. Darüber wurden wir auch gar nicht informiert. Nur auf Nachfrage, weil wir den Bereich aufgrund der riesen größe des Resorts nicht fanden, wurde ich darüber informiert. Grund: Corona-Bestimmungen. Doch auf der EIngangstür des Spa Bereichs entdeckten wir ein Schild mit der Aufschrift: Wegen Umbauarbeiten geschlossen.","* Das Essen war sehr gut! Es gab abwechslungsreiche Küche (Muscheln, Fisch, Veganes, Vegetarisches, Müsli, Obst + Pasta/Pizza/Pancakes jeden Tag!) Dennoch wurde sehr nachhaltig gekocht - es gab viele Aufläufe, wo die Reste vom Vortag gut verwertet wurden. * Das Meer dort ist glasklar und man kann auch viele Fische beobachten!* Es gibt viele Aktivitäten rund um das Resort: Boote kann man ausleihen (man benötigt keinen Führerschein dafür), es gibt eine Quadsafaritour, man kann Schnochrcheln, SUP, ...)","Großes Resort mit super Essen & Meer, doch nichts für romantische Zweisamkeit.","Junior Suite with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","August 2021","6 nights","Couple","https://graph.facebook.com/v2.9/872083366278956/picture?type=square&height=64&width=64","Austria","Thomas"

To reach civilization you need to walk at least 20 minutes to Agia Pelagia village.Can't complain for the price paid, but food was just average, nothing spectacular.All-inclusive drinks (especially ""juices"") are very watered, 6 cocktails included in the all-inclusive package (Blood Mary, Skrewdriver, Tequila Sunrise, Gin Fizz, Daiquiri, Cuba Libre) are prepared using these, so the taste is not great (though Gin Fizz was nice). Wine and beer are just standard all-inclusive, nothing special.Due to the lack of ventilation, there was a constant sewer smell in the bathroom.Wifi access in the room was pretty choppy.Animation only in French, though probably half of hotel visitors were speaking German and Russian. The animation itself looked pretty weak, though we usually ignore it anyways.Our room had a nice 50"" Smart TV, but it wasn't connected to the internet, so we couldn't stream anything from our phones/tablets to it. I know this super geeky complaint, but with that nice equipment it would be really easy to allow younger visitors like us to use TV in the way people use it in 2021 :-)","Amazing views from the hotel.The hotel itself is pretty modern, good facilities, very nice territory.We got a free room upgrade, that was really nice.It's possible to check out later. If it's not possible to stay in the room for a longer time, then it's possible to use separate room to take a shower after the beach.Very nice platform with direct access to the sea (Tsimento).

It exceeded our expectations. We were not expecting the resort to have connections with the villages or Heraklion but there was actually a bus that could take you to the capital of the island in 45 mins for just 3,5€. The building was beautiful and much bigger than we imagined. It had its little beautiful hidden corners and we used the pathways to go for night summer walks.
It was an absolute pleasant stay with the days spent at the beach, on a boat that we rented, and exploring the surroundings of the area. Definitely worth staying in if you want to get to know a little bit of Crete and discover another beautiful part of this planet.

Impossible de faire la grasse mat, le personnel de nettoyage se charge de faire l’animation dans les couloirs entre sonneries de téléphone et conversations plutôt bruyantes…
La nourriture en général, toujours tiède et sans intérêt gustatif particulier. Ne vous attendez  pas à autre chose qu’une grande cantine où la quantité prime nettement sur la qualité.
La faiblesse de la qualité des animations. Les soirées et animations proposées tout au long de la semaine ne sont clairement pas à la hauteur d’un resort hôtel. L’equipe d’animation (très restreinte) fait du mieux qu’elle peut, au vu du nombre de vacanciers et du peu de moyen mis à disposition.
L’absence de douche à proximité des piscines…
Enfin, les horaires en général. Tout est trop tôt !
Bref, dans l’ensemble nous  avons passé un séjour agréable (1 semaine suffit amplement) mais on constate malheureusement le manque de moyen de ce resort, au niveau des équipements comme de l’infrastructure.","La chambre et sa vue mer !

Elles finissent en général tôt, 23h. Et sont en général un peu tristes. La soirée crétoise par contre est vraiment sympathique.
Tout au long de la journée, très peu d’ambiance musicale.
Pas de TPE dans les différents bars de l’hôtel et pas de moyen dématérialisé non plus. Par ailleurs, tout n’est pas accessible partout. Chaque bar a ses spécialités ce qui est dérangeant quand on doit aller de bar en bar pour avoir un petit quelque chose à manger.","La vue sur la mer.

Amper verbinding over de site heen, amper tot niets op de kamer. Voor ons wel een mega afknapper. Aangezien het nooit wijzigt geraak je snel uitgekeken op het ochtendbuffet. All-in is in feite niet helemaal 'all-in'. Als je helemaal tot beneden bent gewandeld om aan de zee te liggen (privé-gedeelte van het hotel), bijvoorbeeld, is het ineens betalend. De eetruimte heeft een prachtig uitzicht maar heeft wel een refter-gevoel én je kan niet buiten eten. De foto's tonen mooie eetruimtes, maar die zijn van de all-a-carte restaurants die overigens niet tegelijk en niet alle dagen geopend zijn. Het kindergedeelte ligt ergens verstopt, ver weg van de andere zwembaden - heel erg jammer. Het badje is niet verwarmd, de speeltuin is klein en niet peutervriendelijk. Desondanks de vele kindjes die we gezien hebben, zat er niemand op deze plek. Airco op de kamer geeft veel licht en geluid af, dan nog liever het raam op kip en af en toe een mug.","Vriendelijk personeel. Het buffet was 's middags en 's avonds heel gevarieerd en uitgebreid voorradig. Het eten en de eetruimte waren ook baby-proof (veel zitjes te vinden). We kregen een ruimere kamer dan we geboekt hadden en genoten zo onverwachts van een aparte slaapkamer voor de baby. Prachtige uitzichten. Géén handdoekleggers! Veel ligplek. Bus naar Heraklion stopt aan de deur. Leuke strandjes in de buurt (horen wel niet bij het hotel).","Voldoende/redelijk mits juiste verwachtingen","Double or Twin Room with Mountain View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2022","7 nights","Family","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-j/f69a0f45af414641ac0371c1f139c49637969c6c.png","Belgium","Julie"

"gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia","fa7935b64eae9bea",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thank you very much for taking the time to share your feedback. We are very sorry to hear that your experience at our resort did not meet your expectations. I wish you had informed us about the cockroaches at the time because there are various actions we can take to remedy the situation instantly. A specialist has informed us that these are forest cockroaches, which means they are found in nature. They are endemic to rural areas all over Crete and various other Greek islands. There is always a slight surge towards the end of July, when the weather is very hot and humid. As you know, the hotel is surrounded by nature and your room specifically was located near the gardens. On our end, we do everything possible to contain the situation, we perform monthly exterminations and are very clean as a unit (our cleanliness rating here is a 9). On the off-chance cockroaches enter guest rooms, we are able to perform a local extermination, which works very efficiently. 
Lastly, to avoid misinformation, there are two all-inclusive bars: the Snack Bar and the Pool Bar. These offer a list of all-inclusive drinks. A small buffet with light eats is available throughout the day at the Snack Bar and a small aperitif at the Pool Bar in the early evening. There is also a self-service drinks point by the salt-water pool. The Lobby Bar and Tsimento Beach Bar are indeed not a part of this plan - these offer a different experience with table service etc. but we now provide booking.com guests with complimentary vouchers so that they can experience these bars too. 
Furthermore, regarding the beaches, all the information is clearly indicated on our website. There is access to two public beaches as well as the Tsimento beach platform, which is indeed a concrete platform. 
Please do reach out to us if you would like to discuss further or if there is anything we can do at this stage. Warm regards and apologies once again.

Спать в этой комнате было невозможно, т.к. слышимость просто ужасная. Ночью пьяные гости громко общались в коридоре, а с 6 утра персонал очень громко переговаривался и гремел инвентарем. Ощущения не из приятных, поспать ночью не получалось.
Все меропрятия в отеле на французском языке. Чувствовали себя из-за этого крайне некомфортно, т.к. французский не знаем.
Уборщица специально приходила в самое жаркое время, когда мы отдыхали в надежде, что мы откажемся от уборки. Когда попросили прийти чуть позже, она нам отказала. Мыло и шампуни старалась недодать, приходилось просить на респешене.
Зонтиков и лежаков на пляже отеля не хватало. Много было посторонних людей, не являющимися гостями отеля. Они занимали лежаки и зонтики чуть ли не на целый день, за этим никто не следил. Бар на пляже платный, в соимость all inclusive не входит. За напитками нужно бежать долго вверх, что неудобно на жаре.","Месторасположение хорошее, красивые виды, бассейны. Море прекрасное.

The price I paid didn't match the overall performance of the hotel. One of the most disappointing aspects was the food. While the online pictures on booking and Google had us excited, the reality was quite different. The food quality, especially at breakfast, was poor.
Additionally, we were under the impression that the stay was all-inclusive, but we were surprised to find out that certain amenities, like wine at the a la carte restaurant, came with an extra charge. This inconsistency left us feeling somewhat frustrated.
For the price paid and the expectations set by the online images, our overall experience was less than satisfying.

Stattdessen gab es einen sirupartigen „Ersatz“ davon, der die Ankunft und die Zeit dort nicht unerheblich getrübt hat. Dies ist uns in all den Jahren noch nie untergekommen und war ein großes Manko. Entweder man nimmt Orange Carbonated oder mischt sich den normalen Orangensaft mit Mineralwasser, um auf einen fantaähnlichen Geschmack zu kommen.
- Auch bei den Aufstrichen muss man Kompromisse eingehen, auch wenn dies natürlich sehr subjektiv zu bewerten ist:
Die Schokoladencreme war mit etwas wie Nutella keinesfalls zu vergleichen und auch die Marmelade hat eher enttäuscht.
- Zudem gab es zwar Spiegelei, aber nicht direkt Rührei, sondern eine Art zerkleinertes Omelette, was aber geschmacklich nur befriedigend war und nicht wie erhofft hervorragend.
- Die vorgenannten Punkte haben insbesondere das Frühstück nicht zur Lieblingsmahlzeit werden lassen, auch wenn man doch immer etwas gefunden hat und gestärkt in den Tag starten konnte.
- Wenngleich die Aussicht einfach fantastisch ist, ist das Resort doch sehr abgelegen und es gibt kaum Möglichkeiten, fußläufig mal „rauszukommen“ und die Umgebung zu erkunden. Auch fehlt gänzlich die Option eines (romantischen) Spaziergangs an der Promenade. Man ist auf ein Auto angewiesen, will man mehr von Griechenland sehen.
- Das Areal ist sehr weitläufig und nicht ideal ausgeschildert, sodass es anfangs durchaus mal vorkommen kann, dass man sich auf dem Weg zum hotelfremden Sandstrand oder der hoteleigenen Tsimento Beach Bar verläuft und ein bisschen länger braucht.
- Das WLAN auf dem Zimmer war sehr schwach ausgeprägt und nahezu nicht nutzbar.","- die Aussicht war grandios, das Meer bildschön
- das Animationsteam und deren Programm:
am Tag: zahlreiche sportliche Aktivitäten wie Volleyball, Fußball, Boule/Bolcha/Boccia, Wasserpolo/Wasserball, Darts und andere
am Abend: sehr unterhaltsame Quiz-Nights, bei denen es zum Beispiel darum ging, anhand von Soundtracks die Filme zuzuordnen oder auch Tanzshows (East & West Show) - da ist für jeden etwas dabei :)
- das Spa mit Efi und Sula laden einfach zur Entspannung ein
- die Quad-Safari sowie das beste Sandwich aus Gyros mit Pitabrot in Fodele ;)","Es war ein sehr schöner Aufenthalt in Griechenland in einem sehr schönen Hotel, den man trotz einiger Abstriche auch wir","Double or Twin Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","October 2023","9 nights","Couple","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-n/d3882ab9674d57559f4b0ecc7f2b01ecbc7a8057.png","Germany","Nathalie"

Das Hotel ist an in einen Hang gebaut, was natürlich eine super Lage ist, aber auch viele Treppen bedeutet. Somit hatten wir leider nicht die Möglichkeit mit den Kindern überall bequem hinzukommen. Dazu kommt dass die Strände nur sehr klein sind und auch nicht Kinder geeignet. Kurz um: das Hotel ist super für Singles oder auch Paare ohne kleine Kinder, aber in unseren Augen nicht für Familien geeignet, zumindest nicht für Familien mit Kindern unter 3 Jahren (u.a. Musik am Hauptpool, lange Wege mit Treppen, laute Animation am Abend).","Die Lage ist super, wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Meerblick, das war wunderschön. Das Buffet ist üppig, Personal sehr freundlich und serviceorientiert. Da wir Probleme hatten mit der Familientauglichkeit, wurde uns sehr schnell und unkompliziert geholfen und auch immer wieder Hilfe angeboten. Das fanden wir sehr gut.

Однажды полотенец при замене тоже положили на двоих, но это мелочи, на которые можно не обратить внимания. Из неудобств можно отметить, что в ванной комнате нашего номера унитаз установлен достаточно высоко и для людей с небольшим ростом это будет неудобно. Слабенький вай фай, но если без фанатизма, то этого достаточно выйти в социальные сети.","Приветливый и внимательный персонал, все наши вопросы всегда решались. В последний день пребывания  отключился кондиционер, позвонили на ресепшн и через некоторое время проблема была устранена. Очень хорошая территория отеля, можно бесконечно долго гулять (на территории много котиков), понравился нижний бассейн с морской водой это идеальное место после целого дня поездок по острову, народа в нем практически никогда не было, но тут все таки осень сказывается. Уборка номера ежедневно. Удобная кровать, по две подушки на каждого разной жесткости. Может нам повезло с соседями, но было тихо и мы хорошо высыпались. Что касается еды устраивало все, объедались каждый день, все свежее, без излишеств, но ассортимент вполне хороший, предлагались блюда из разных кухонь. Был вечер критской кухни с улитками и другими морепродуктами. Вкусные панкейки и сладкий апельсиновый фреш. Отдельно хочу сказать про вид из номера, у нас он был чудесный, каждый день мы встречали солнце - это незабываемо красиво. О транспортном сообщении. Лучше, конечно, брать в аренду авто и колесить по острову свободно. При отеле есть небольшая  территория для парковки, мы первые дни приезжали поздно, но всегда находили место. Без машины из отеля можно добраться на автобусе до Ираклиона (автобус останавливается напротив ресепшн). Но очень мало рейсов. Последний автобус стартует из Ираклиона в 17.30 а так хотелось бы погулять по вечернему Ираклиону! Альтернатива такси, но дорого, сорок евро. Рядом с отелем есть еще два пляжа, нужно всего лишь спуститься вниз. Нам по душе пришелся Psaromoura beach, он меньше, но уютнее. Шезлонги и зонтики на нем платные, мелкая галька, заход в воду плавный, вода нереально красивая, берите маску и ласты для сноркелинга.Анимация как все пишут и правда только на французском, но при отличном настроении язык юмора звучит одинаково на всех языках.","Уютный Resort с отличной территорией для отдыха и прогулок","Two-Bedroom Family Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2021","9 nights","Family","https://xx.bstatic.com/xdata/images/xphoto/square64/33426706.jpg?k=f8a0d0bbd958e675a01d8b727c206beebd655abdab9404503fe9bc2df2713601&o=","Russia","Shinyfox"

- Man fühlte sich nicht als ob man in Griechenland die Ferien verbringt, sondern irgendwo in Nizza in Frankreich. Alles war nur auf Französisch.
- Unterhaltungsprogramme ansonsten auch nicht interessant, bis auf einen Abend als man Sirtaki vorgeführt hatte.
- Alkoholische Getränke die im All-Inclusive sind, sind leider nicht die besten Getränke.
- Wlan funktioniert auf den Zimmern sehr schlecht
- Wir hatten ein Taxi um 11:00 Uhr für um 18:00 Uhr bestellt (Flughafentransfer), jedoch kam das Taxi um 18:40 Uhr und das Personal war sehr Respektlos und sagten mir alle 5 Minuten „das Taxi kommt, relax“ - schlussendlich war die Situation für uns am Flughafen wahnsinnig stressig.

- Personnel à la limite du manque de respect, nous avons été volée d’un collier avec kara bleu alors qu’il était posé sur notre table de nuit, le lendemain matin après que la chambre est été nettoyée, PLUS RIEN.
Après 48h l’hôtel revient vers nous et nous propose UN SPA en guise de « relaxation »
- Buffet à la limite du 3 étoiles, les fruits était toujours les mêmes : pastèque et melon jaune.
Pas de très grande qualité et non variés
- Dans la description de l’hôtel il était noté qu’il y avait plusieurs snacks et bars d’ouvert, en effet il y avait absolument RIEN pour manger entre les repas, tout de même très désagréable surtout quand on a pris le ALL INCLUSIVE.
- Dans cet hôtel, en all inclusive, le café est à 2,50€ et la bouteille d’eau 1€ , sans compter des « véritables choses «  qui était inclus dans la formule... vraiment désastreux.
- Piscine à l’eau extrêmement salée je pense que c’est de l’eau de mer mais personnellement je n’ai pas aimé surtout quand on voit comment elle est entretenue.
- Pour finir, cet hôtel nous a clairement gâché notre séjour, heureusement que nous avions loué des voitures pour manger à l’extérieur et profiter réellement des paysages et de la bonne nourriture que peu offrir la Crète.","La vue","Disappointing","Double or Twin Room with Mountain View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","June 2021","7 nights","Family","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-l/c9a51000ce90cbf81dcc81b847f9bccc3330d3a4.png","France","Lauréna"

It's manageable, but staff could keep a better eye on the practice. With the room housekeeping, it would be nice to have fresh water replaced daily in the fridge. The same applies to the tea and instant coffee ( saying that a simple note to housekeeping and they provided more of everything).

We are very sorry to hear you had a frustrating experience, but we truly appreciate you bringing these issues to our attention. Our team is striving for the best and we regret not being able to accommodate you. However, we would like to share our response to the problems raised. Regarding the mosquitoes, this year, the government made the decision not to exterminate as the process proved harmful to bees (which have a significant cultural and ecological importance to the island). Despite this, we performed an extermination locally. Unfortunately, there is not much else we can do about this. This is the downside of being in a warm environment, close to nature. Generally, we have tried to create a comprehensive but also competitive all-inclusive package. Our website clearly indicates what is included: peninsula.gr/all-inclusive. This season, thus far, we have largely received positive feedback regarding food - particularly at Parasia Restaurant. But of course, we cannot cater to everyone’s taste and are sorry to hear you didn’t enjoy the à la carte meal we offered you. Indeed July and August is a popular period for families. There are many children around. It is good for guests looking for something quieter and a more peaceful setting to be aware of this. For the issues you faced in your guest room, you have every right to be upset. Our staff tried to address the problems and compensate for this. Unfortunately, as it seems, we truly failed.

There were bugs everywhere in our room, including waking up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and finding a dying cockroach. Seems like this place is only good for families, but if you want to hear slamming and kids screaming your whole duration, then you can here. They call it all inclusive but it's barely that. Anything decent you have to pay for. Also we had a ""private pool"" which isnt private it all, and also so cold you can't even put your feet in.

Lorsque vous choisissez votre plat, préférez clairement la nourriture locale (plats en sauce), car les plats européens (pizzas, pâtes, frites…) ne sont vraiment pas au niveau d’un point de vue gustatif : ce n’est fin du tout, surtout les desserts qui sont très fades, à l’exception des pâtisseries locales avec du miel.
Le petit déjeuner est le moins réussi des repas : omelette au lieu des œufs brouillés, ils sont cuisinés minute sous vos yeux et on ne comprend pas trop pourquoi car cela engendre de l’attente inutile. Idem pour ce qui est des jus d’orange pressés devant vous, avec une file d’attente parfois inutilement longue et si vous arrivez trop tard il n’y en a tout simplement plus donc vous devrez vous rabattre sur le jus d’orange sans goût de la fontaine. les viennoiseries sont aux abonnés absents : il y a une tentative de croissants et petits pains mais je vous les déconseille formellement, vraiment…
Les boissons enfin sont en fontaine exclusivement, mais tout en marque low-cost donc niveau goût c’est très décevant, et parfois même extrêmement fade quand la Fontaine n’a pas été rechargée, ce qui arrive assez souvent.
Notez que les cocktails (mojitos…) des bars plage et lobby sont vraiment excellents et très bien servis, mais non compris dans le All-in.
Bref beaucoup de bonne volonté mais encore des progrès a faire pour les repas.
Néanmoins cela n’a pas ruiné notre séjour, on s’attendait juste à un peu mieux.","Très accueillant, l’emplacement est idéal, le complexe est bien entretenu et très propre, y compris les piscines. Les chambres sont confortables, et la propreté est irréprochable. Le cadre est absolument superbe, les bâtiments sont beaux et accueillants, les espaces verts dispersés dans l’hôtel sont magnifiques et très bien entretenus. Le complexe organisé en plusieurs bâtiments/terrasses est agréable à parcourir, sur plusieurs niveaux bien accessibles. Il y a aussi une plage privée réservée à l’hôtel (en béton, mais très agréable, bien mieux que les 2 plages en gravier autour de l’hôtel) ce qui est appréciable afin de ne pas devoir louer de transat/parasol en plus.
Nous logions dans une chambre supérieure avec vue mer qui était idéalement située par rapport aux piscines et pas trop proche des animations qui auraient pu perturber notre sommeil.
L’accueil en français était excellent, toutes nos demandes ont été satisfaites. Les locations de voiture et de bateaux sont à proximité immédiate de l’hôtel et très disponibles.
Bref un excellent séjour, idéal pour une semaine de rêve sous le soleil.","Excellent séjour dans un magnifique hôtel superbement situé et très accueillant.","Superior Double Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","July 2022","7 nights","Family","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhmLHZITqtUeqXWdakcsSVX6cP9jwla8LfpBVFczQ=s96-c","France","Arnaud"

Мы сюда первый раз приехали в 2022 , и когда я уезжала я загадала вернуться еще раз. И вот летом 2023 мы вернулись, и это были самые лучшие дни нашего отпуска.

Pas très bonne qualité, non variés, le café sans gout ni arome, le personnel pas souriant ni dynamique. no stress c est la Grèce. Aucun contact avec le personnel du restaurant ce qui est dommage. J ai séjourné dans bcp d hôtel de catégorie identique et même en all inclusive il y  avait des serveurs pour les boissons, le personnel souriant et avenant. Ici très souvent les tables n étaient pas encore débarrassées ni prêtes. Ambiance cantine. Les animateurs pas intéressants du tout, chaque semaine la même chose. Le répertoire des chansons pas terrible. L anglais n est pas très bien maitrisé. Bcp de touriste Français, je suppose que c est un hôtel ""Français"" d'où la mauvaise nourriture et ambiance. Quand on compare aux endroits en Espagne ou d'autres en Grece (avec des vrais grecs), il n'y a pas photo. La soirée Crétoise était bien, encore une preuve que la mauvaise ambiance venait du fait des animateurs Français car les grecs savent également mettre l ambiance! Les boissons all inclusive HORRIBLES! Le serveur dont je ne connais pas le nom mais qui n'est pas grec je dirai peut être malgache TRES TRES antipathique, non serviable. Nous lui avons demandé une boisson qu il avait dirait on la flemme de faire et il nous en a servi une autre que l on a pas demandé. Il travaille au TSIMENTO et au bar de l hôtel. Le SPA a l 'air correct, sauf que j ai du payer un soin de 50 minute plein tarif alors qu il n a duré que 30 min.","Notre chambre avec vue était parfaite.

Ich habe vor dem Buchen die Bewertungen zu diesem Hotel durchgelesen und gedacht Soooo
schlimm kann es ja nicht sein,was manche Leute schreiben.
ABER.....
Diese Bewertung geht an ALLE DEUTSCHE, die Vorhaben diese Anlage zu buchen.
Dieses Hotel ist in französischer Hand🤚und wenn IHR damit klar kommt diskriminiert und ausgegrenzt zu werden. Okay!!!!
Ansonsten lasst die Finger davon, denn ALLE die nicht Franzosen sind, sind hier unsichtbar 🤮
Die Animation ist Nur auf französisch,wenn du Das nicht sprechen kannst wirst Du von dem tollen 🙄französischen Animateur Johann jeden Abend übergangen.
Wusste auch bisher noch nicht, dass neuerdings französisch die internationale Weltsprache ist.🤷‍♀️
Die Franzosen haben zu 95% blaue Bänder,und somit immer mehr Rechte als Du.
Ich fühlte mich hier wirklich unwohl.
Und nach meiner Beschwerde bei Booking sollte ich mit Cocktails und einem A la carte Essen abgespeist werden, was nicht wirklich das Problem in diesem Hotel löst.
Ich habe schon viel erlebt und auch viel bereist, aber dieses Resort toppt bisher Alles.
Hallo, ich bin auf Creta,in Griechenland und nicht in Frankreich.
Übrigens möchte Ich auch an dieser Stelle betonen, dass ich nichts gegen Franzosen habe,aber sie bemühen sich ja auch noch nicht mal dir auf Englisch entgegen zu kommen.
Nicht Alle hatten französisch in der Schule.
Je ne parle francais.","Hallo Leute.
Dieses ist der positive Teil meiner ehrlichen Bewertung. Bitte lest auch den negativen dazu,denn der ist ausschlaggebender für MICH.
Dieses Hotel ist von der Lager her ziemlich außergewöhnlich.
Auf und in einem Felsen gebaut,mit vielen verschiedenen Etagen und natürlich auch ebenso vielen Treppen.
Daher für gehbehinderte und kleinen Kindern eher nicht geeignet.
Über diese Treppen rauf und runter erreichst du 3 verschiedene Pools.
Jeder für sich toll.
Uns hat die Betonplattform am Meer am Besten gefallen. Soooo klares tolles Wasser. Du bekamst auch immer eine Liege.(Vorsasion)
Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit eigenem Pool 😍🙏
einfach nur ein Traum. Tägliche Reinigung und frische Handtücher fürs Zimmer sowie für den Pool.
Das Essen ist abwechslungsreich und frisch zubereitet. Da ist wirklich für jeden was dabei.
Wer da nichts findet, jammert auf hohem Niveau.
Die Getränke für All in sind auch soweit ok.
Bier,Wein,usw. Was erwartet ihr in soooo einer großen Anlage.
Wer einen guten Cocktail oder Wein 🍷 möchte muss ihn bezahlen,aber auch Das kann ich verstehen.(Zutaten eben)Danke Yannis
Das Personal könnte freundlicher sein,aber wenn man ein nettes Kallimera rausbekommt,dann erhält man ein Lächeln.
Allerdings bekommt die nette😬junge Dame,die morgens im Eingangsbereich steht, den Mund gar nicht auf.👎","Urlaub mit Abstrichen😬","Superior Sea View Room with Private Pool","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","June 2022","14 nights","Couple","https://xx.bstatic.com/xdata/images/xphoto/square64/50846227.jpg?k=663c12ee0bf77f2320a6f6db063a6c3f93ca54ab72af7bb246b2dbc6a54be264&o=","Germany","Apriliagirl"

1: The word ""subordination"" has apparently never been heard of here.  The cleaning lady allowed herself to enter the room when the hotel guests were ""sleeping"", walked through the whole room to put water in the refrigerator, even though she was asked not to enter the room in English.  But the cleaning ladies in this hotel do not speak English at all.  The dish cleaners in the dining room, apparently due to the lack of knowledge of any even basic English, allowed themselves to go up to the table where we have been dining and knocked on it, saying something in Greek in a rude tone with a displeased face.  In general, any request such as pouring water or coffee is perceived as a favor, is done very slow and with the same displeased face.  To get an espresso in the morning is a whole quest: you need to find a person who has a ""clearance level"" for the coffee machine, then water is added there for about 5 minutes, coffee is added, in the process the employee responsible for this can leave somewhere without saying a word, and all this with  the same displeased expression on his face.  Hotel staff - smile at least sometimes))
2. It is required to wear a mask in the dining room, although masks are not provided.
3. The territory of the hotel, in particular all the sidewalks, are preferred to be washed during the day, so you need to either fly over a puddle or swim in it like pigs.  I saw this for the first time.  Usually, even in Egypt, this happens in the early morning (while everyone is sleeping).
4. The level of room cleaning service is as bad as in the motel. Either they won't supply the water, or the floor will be washed with a dirty, stinking rag. The bed upon arrival was in some kind of small lumps of paper.  After my complaint over the phone, nothing happened, after going to the reception and complaining in person, they brought a new bed lining and just placed it on the bed. I had to change the lining  myself.","+:
1. Free of charge late check-out at 18:00
2. Beautiful nature and crystal clear water in the sea
3. Spacious room with a large terrace and panoramic view on the bay.
4. Food: good pastry and pizza.
5. Nice shop in 10 minutes walk with fruits and a good selection of wines without extra tourist surcharge.
6. I recommend to take running shoes,  you can explore stunning cliffs around with breathtaking views on the seashore.

3. Просторный номер с большой террасой и панорамным видом на бухту.
4. Еда: хороший кондитер и пицца.
5. Хороший магазинчик в 10 минутах ходьбы с фруктами и хорошим выбором вина без туристической наценки.

Für die 4 Sterne passt einfach sehr vieles nicht. Kaputte Wände, viele Stellen nicht sehr sauber oder schimmelig, die Zimmer unglaublich hellhörig. Das Abendprogramm war bis auf eine Ausnahme von minderer Qualität.
Aber was uns wirklich enttäuscht hat waren die AI-Getränke. Billigsirup-Getränke und Cocktails auf Knopfdruck aus einem Automaten, die durch Süßungsmittel nur so trotzten. Die Bedienung hat auf Nachfrage nur einen Cocktail aus dem Automaten benannt, der für sie genießbar sei (mit Wasser verdünnt). Möchte man einen normalen Cocktail haben (wie man ihn sonst in Hotels oder Gastronomie bekommt), so darf man fast 10 Euro bezahlen. Wir sind dann hauptsächlich bei Wasser und Wein geblieben (der Hauswein ist aber gut). Der morgendliche Kaffee wird auch nicht aus der Bohne, sondern Konzentrat gemacht und ist geschmacklich eine Beleidigung. Normaler Kaffee kostet wieder extra. Wem die Getränke wichtig sind - sucht euch etwas anderes.","Im Großen und Ganzen war es gur, viel zu machen, einiges gegen Aufpreis.

We loved our stay and would absolutely visit again.","Agia Pelagia is in a secluded location about 25 minutes west of Heraklion. The Peninsula resort itself is perched on top of a hill and is directly atop the sea, which makes for a very scenic location. Everywhere you look, there is an amazing view of the cobalt waters of the Sea of Crete amidst mountains. It's an all-inclusive resort with two swimming pools and large rooms that can each sleep 4 individuals. We were a group of 10 and really enjoyed everything the resort had to offer. The drinks and vibe at the main bar were awesome. Loved the live entertainment as well. This was a relaxing sojourn for us after a hectic few days exploring Athens and Western Crete. And we truly relaxed.

Ok so let’s start first with the location which in my opinion is one pitoresque( mountain view). Located on top  of a peninsula you can get the best  views possible of sunset and of moon above the Mediterranean Sea.
The room …. Wow… we opted for a double room with sea view ( the pictures attached most probably will be very explicit) + spotless clean
ALL INCLUSIVE- literally a great variety of traditional and international food varieties from wich you can choose
The staff kind, helpful and friendly… 5 stars for the chefs and kitchen team, 5 stars for the restaurant team.
I warmly recommend a stay for at least 5 days.","Exceptional","Double or Twin Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","August 2023","10 nights","Family","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-a/2c7be68fb3f987f1352e7b289d4b24137e1a283d.png","Romania","Adiaconitei"

Forse rafforzerei solo questo aspetto, mettendo qualcosa di piú coinvolgente e giovanile. Per intrattenerci abbiamo utilizzato la sala da biliardo, che però è fruibile solo fino alle 23.","La struttura è veramente curata e molto pulita. Il personale della reception è molto gentile e disponibile per eventuali informazioni, vi spiegheranno come orientarvi perché la struttura è veramente molto vasta.
Abbiamo avuto inizialmente un problema con la camera che abbiamo prenotato, non so di quale natura fosse, ma ci hanno dato una camera che ha fatto scomparire ogni malumore. Spettacolare, la stanza piú bella che io abbia mai visto, da restare con il fiato sospeso.
Per quanto riguarda i pasti, noi avevamo la soluzione All inclusive ed avevamo libero accesso a bevande e buffet. La qualità è veramente ottima, cibo vario e saporito, tradizionale greco e continentale, dalla colazione alla cena. Anche gli spuntini durante la giornata non sono da meno, sempre molto ricchi, freschi e per ogni gusto (pancake, biscotti, barrette, torte salate, tartine...).
Le spiagge a vostra disposizione sono 3:
Tsimento si trova direttamente sotto il resort, è un basamento di cemento con ombrelloni e sdraio a disposizione che affaccia subito sul mare aperto. Sembra una grande piscina tanto è bella e celeste l'acqua.
Mononafitis è una spiaggia con l'acqua talmente trasparente da essere impalpabile, perfetta per chi vuole fare snorkeling tra le meraviglie del mare cristallino. L'ombrellone qui ha un costo di 10 euro, ombrellone e due lettini in legno rivestiti con comodi cuscini (veramente pochissimo per quello che ha da offrirti il posto).
Psaromoura è una piccola spiaggetta situata alla destra del resort sempre attrezzata con ombrelloni e con bellissima acqua. Non posso dire molto perché l'abbiamo raggiunta in barca quindi non siamo stati fisicamente sul bagnasciuga. Posso garantire però per la sua bellezza.
Nonostante il vento, caratteristico dell'isola, il mare è sempre calmo e vivibile perfino di notte.","Una vacanza da sogno","Double or Twin Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","August 2022","5 nights","Couple","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-m/0e43c9b9a23d334b52510a328641c048847226bc.png","Italy","Marika"

Si nous avions été au courant nous n’aurions pas réservé dans cet hôtel. La moitié (voire plus) des clients étaient francophones … pour le dépaysement nous repasserons.
- La première chambre que nous avons eue. Nous étions sensés avoir une vue montagne et nous avons eu une chambre vue mer, au-dessus de la piscine, au-dessus immédiatement du restaurant et en-dessous d’un bar qui passe de la musique tout le temps. Absolument pas au calme, nous avons dû demander à changer de chambre, ce qui a été accepté par le personnel. La deuxième chambre était bien à l’écart et vraiment très bien, rien à redire.
- Le parking. Il ne peut accueillir qu’une trentaine de voiture au maximum, il est occupé à son étage supérieur par des quads de l’activité d’à côté et par des voitures de location. Ce qui fait que si vous désirez vous garer vous devrez très probablement passer a l’étage inférieur qui est accessible par une rampe d’accès très difficile en voiture (pente ++++ et gros trous). Nous avons même crus ne pas savoir remonter. Je ne suis même pas sûr que les grosses voitures savent y entrer. Le parking est assez loin de la réception et de l’hôtel en général. Nous avons même été bloqués par les quads quand nous avons dû repartir pour l’hôtel !
- La route d’accès. Route plutôt compliquée, étroite et longue. Sortie d’autoroute atroce et très mal indiquée (nous n’avons toujours pas compris par où passer pour remonter sur l’autoroute sans prendre de sens interdit). Il faut quasi compter 15 min pour rejoindre l’autoroute de l’hôtel.
- Le buffet. Très peu de mets locaux et d’une qualité qui est plutôt digne d’une cantine que d’un hôtel 4 étoiles. Très peu varies. Maintenant si vous aimez les pâtes, les pizzas et les frites il est fait pour vous. Nous étions en all-in mais nous avons préféré manger à plusieurs reprises à l’extérieur tellement nous n’avons pas aimé la...","- La vue était très belle, sur les deux lagunes avoisinantes

Wenn Sie dann nebem dem Kinderplanschbecken den Weg in den Keller zum ""Spa"" gefunden haben, werden sie mit einem verkniffenen Lächeln darüber informiert, dass man nicht die notwendigen Materialien zur Behandlung hat und man sich darüber bewusst ist, dass es in der Broschüre steht. 2.Das Essen, welches in den anderen Bewertungen so ausgewählt gelobt wurde, lässt sich bestenfalls als Kantinenessen beschreiben. Die Vielfalt besteht morgens aus knorpeligen Restefleisch und einer Auswahl an fast aufgebackenen Brot und Minicroissants. Obst findet sich auf einer kleinen Anrichte und besticht durch die Schwierigkeit gefunden zu werden. Falls jemand die Hoffnung auf frischen Saft oder überhaupt Saft hat, lasst es gut sein! Im besten Fall ist es Orangenlimonade, angerührt aus Pulver. Ähnlich zum ""Joghurt"", welcher aus Wasser und angerührten Milchpulver besteht.3.Strand: Der hauseigene ""Strand"" - eine Betonbucht ohne Sand und einer altersschwachen Leiter um ins Meer zu fallen. Die Liegen und Schirme müssen übrigens bei allen Alternativen extra bezahlt werden.Die zweite Alternative ist eine Kloake, bei welcher der Geruch nach Urin erst im Meer aufhört. Am besten werden dabei bestimmte Badeschuhe getragen (Steine, Kiesel,...). Die letzte Alternative wird durch einen Fußweg erreicht und ist ähnlich steinig und teuer.","Der Ausblick und das azurblaue Meer.","Nie wieder!","Junior Suite with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2021","7 nights","Couple","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-w/743312ca303f4a4be7af10e6d1015d40a0ce81a4.png","Taiwan","Wiebke"

Wir sind dann einen Tag später, weil das Hotel voll ausgebucht war umgezogen, hätten uns aber natürlich diesen Stress gern erspart. Man hat ja Urlaub! Zimmer war grundsätzlich sauber, aber auch hier wäre es wünschenswert gewesen tote Insekten von den Wänden zu wischen.
Verpflegung war okay. Das Beste hier war das Frühstücksbuffet. Mittags und vor allem Abends hätte die Auswahl an gegrilltem Fleich größer sein können. Snacks gab es auch nur an dem Hauptpool.
Das All Inclusive Offer war nicht an jeder Bar in vollem Umfang gegeben.
Liegen nah am Meer mussten morgens leider früh reserviert werden, damit man noch einen Platz ergattern konnte.
Kann nicht ganz verstehen woher die guten Rezensionen kommen.

Заказывали ужин в местном алякарт в ночь лобстера, 50 евро с человека плюс 19 евро бутылка вина - не советую повторять, потерянные деньги, вкусным был только суп, в Ираклионе за эти же деньги можно поесть действительно вкусной еды, а десерт вам принесут бесплатно в качестве комплимента вместе с раки.
Развлечений нет. Развлекательная программа только на французском, но даже если перевести ее на английский язык - лучше не станет, это просто не весело. Бильярдных стола всего 2, играть можно только до 10 вечера, до бара от бильярда далеко, одна игра (не час игры, а именно одна игра) стоит 2 евро.
Бесплатные лежаки только на бетонном пляже. Олл инклюзив вино и пиво наливают только на бетонном пляже, коктейлей не наливают, хотя они все равно ужасные. Платные коктейли на бетонном пляже очень хороши, от 7 до 10 евро за коктейль. На остальных пляжах все за деньги.
Еда не самая вкусная. До прибытия в этот отель провели 5 дней в Ираклионе, питаясь местной едой в кафешках - есть с чем сравнить.
Вообще нет смысла брать все включено. На пляже есть несколько таверн, где можно поужинать. Поскольку делать все равно нечего, прогулка 15 минут в Агию Пелагию за ужином может быть развлечением.","Месторасположение! Отель имеет выход к трём разным пляжам, бухта очень красивая. Тихая деревня рядом.
В номере хорошо убирали и меняли полотенца каждый день.
Отель очень интересный: когда проходишь от номера к пляжу или от пляжа к ресторану идёшь через туннели в скале - очень здорово.","Хорошо","Double or Twin Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2021","6 nights","Couple","https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WR7LZBC8q-Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACPM/tGqGJ0Zczbk/s96-c/photo.jpg","Ukraine","Sofia"

Очень много ступеней, с коляской иногда проехать трудно. Детский клуб на карте не обозначен, находится среди кустов и деревьев, где много комаров, меня и ребенка искусали. В клубе все валяется, никто не проводит уборку, няни, конечно, никакой нет. Вся анимация в отеле на французском, иногда персонал не понимает даже английский. Вишенка на торте - требование об оплате услуг спа после нашего отъезда, расскажу подробнее: при выезде нам озвучили сумму, которую мы должны доплатить за услуги спа - около 220 евро, оплатили картой, уехали. Добирались домой с пересадкой в Москве, прилетаем домой, загружаемся в машину и едем довольные, тут раздается звонок из отеля - здравствуйте, вы не оплатили услуги спа! Отвечаю что все было оплачено при выезде, на что мне заявляют что они забыли посчитать еще одну процедуру стоимостью 50 евро. Отвечаю что у них есть номер карты, пусть спишут оттуда. На что мне сказали: назовите полный номер карты, срок действия и cvv код!!!! Я в шоке, говорю что ничего не собираюсь называть. Я считаю что это ошибка отеля, раз вы не сможете корректно выставить счет - разбирайтесь внутри себя. Я еду зарулем, мне вообще неудобно разговаривать, девушку это не волнует вообще. Разговор длился всю нашу дорогу домой, в ответ только наезды что мы отказываемся оплачивать и прочее. В итоге мне пришлось создать виртуальную карту, закинуть на нее деньги, чтобы они от нас отстали. Заплатили мы за проживание 3000 евро, конечно 50 евро мы разорили бы отель. Просто позорище для отеля 4 звезд! Персонал абсолютно не умеет общаться с клиентами. Все плюсы перечеркнул данный инциндент, никогда не вернемся в данный отель. К уборке тоже есть вопросы: после уборки остается много длинных черных волос, уборщица может не успеть убрать номер, потому что одна она не справляется.  Также при заезде в номере отсутствовал сейф, пытались 3 дня добиться его установки.","Разнообразное питание, наличие бассейна с морской водой, доступ к нескольким пляжам","Pleasant","Two-Bedroom Family Room with Sea View","https://www.booking.com/hotel/gr/peninsula-agia-pelagia.pt-br.html?aid=304142&label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaLsBiAEBmAEtuAEXyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELiAIBqAIDuALUqsSuBsACAdICJDA2Y2QxMDdjLWM4NGItNDVhNy1hYjdjLTE1ZTAzMzNiYmUxOdgCBuACAQ&sid=f18cb1227ca7f7db308b77bbaaa8d0b8&all_sr_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;checkin=2024-06-11;checkout=2024-06-14;dest_id=811;dest_type=region;dist=0;group_adults=2;group_children=0;hapos=3;highlighted_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;hpos=3;matching_block_id=34087707_88569920_2_85_0;no_rooms=1;req_adults=2;req_children=0;room1=A%2CA;sb_price_type=total;sr_order=popularity;sr_pri_blocks=34087707_88569920_2_85_0__54420;srepoch=1708285644;srpvid=8f4d8b230be202ed;type=total;ucfs=1&#hotelTmpl","September 2021","11 nights","Family","https://cf.bstatic.com/static/img/review/avatars/ava-e/8d80ab6bf73fa873e990c76bfc96a1bf23708307.png","Russia","Ekaterina"
